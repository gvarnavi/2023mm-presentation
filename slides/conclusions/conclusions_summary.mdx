## Conclusions

- Developed novel algorithm &rarr; magnetic potential reconstruction
  - Requires no prior-knowledge
  - Robust against low signal-to-noise datasets
  - Enables independent electrostatic/magnetic regularizations

- Demonstrated algorithm utility in simulated non-periodic samples
  - Enables the differentiation between antiferromagnetic orderings
