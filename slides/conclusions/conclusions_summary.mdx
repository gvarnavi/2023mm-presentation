## Conclusions

- Implemented a suite of open-source phase retrieval algorithms
  - Particular emphasis on robustness against experimental artifacts

- Developed novel reconstruction algorithm &rarr; magnetic potential 
  - Requires no prior-knowledge (e.g. sample periodicity)
  - Robust against low signal-to-noise datasets
  - Enables independent electrostatic/magnetic regularizations

- Demonstrated algorithm utility in simulated non-periodic samples
  - Enables the differentiation between antiferromagnetic orderings
